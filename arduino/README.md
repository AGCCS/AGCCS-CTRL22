# Arduino Firmware ESP32/AVR

In parallel to our main intent to organise a network of charging station, we plant to provide a simple stand-alone configuration, i.e., charging from solar power while available. In order to be more easily adaptable to individual use cases, we prefer the commonly accepted Arduino programming environment / programming style for this purpose. 



## ESP32 firmware based on ESP32 Arduino Core

- Web-GUI to monitor and control the AGCCS-CTRL22 board via the traditional AVR firmware

- control/monitor via external MQTT broker

- firmware update via Arduino OTA, i.e., functional from the Arduino IDE (OTA update of the target AVR (not yet implemented)

  

## AVR firmware base on Arduino XMegaCoreX 

[nothing ready to share at this point of time -- not sure, how to go with this, in particular the current measurement]
