# Monitor Server Software

At the time of writing, we provide only a very elemantary monitoring software `dmctrl.py`, see [./utils](../utils/). The development of a practical tool to operate the network of charging stations is currently being conducted by Xinhuang Gong as part of his MA thesis project at FAU/Erlangen/Germany. An early preview is available in the separate repositories [AGCCS/monitor](http://github.com/AGCCS/monitor) and [AGCCS/UI-server](http://github.com/AGCCS/ui-server)  --- stay tuned.
